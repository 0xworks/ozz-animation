ozz-animation is an open source c++ 3d skeletal animation engine. It provides runtime character animation playback functionalities (loading, sampling, blending...), with full support for Collada and Fbx import formats. It proposes a low-level renderer agnostic and game-engine agnostic implementation, focusing on performance and memory constraints with a data-oriented design.

ozz-animation comes with Collada and Fbx toolchains to convert from major Digital Content Creation formats to ozz optimized runtime structures. Offline libraries are also provided to implement the conversion from any other animation and skeleton formats.
